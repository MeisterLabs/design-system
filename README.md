## Meister Design System (MDS)

The main goal of the Meister Design System is to give developers and designers a common ground to build fantastic experiences for our clients,
across MindMeister, MeisterNote and MeisterTask. This can be achieve through a set of Design Tokens, guidelines and best practices. This system is in its first iteration and is constantly evolving.
