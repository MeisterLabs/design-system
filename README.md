## Meister Design System (MDS)

The main goal of the Meister Design System is to give developers and designers a common ground to build fantastic experiences for our clients,
across MindMeister, MeisterNote and MeisterTask. This can be achieve through a set of Design Tokens, guidelines and best practices. This system is in its first iteration and is constantly evolving.

- [Report an issue](https://github.com/MeisterLabs/design-system/issues/new/choose)

If you would like to be part of the Design System Team, please send a message to [Ben](mailto:benjamin.caillet@meisterlabs.com). As MDS is at a very early stage, we are integrating new members very slowly to keep focus on building the foundations.
